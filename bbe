 The book of the generations of Jesus Christ
 the son of David
 the son of Abraham.
 The son of Abraham was Isaac
 and the son of Isaac was Jacob
 and the sons of Jacob were Judah and his brothers
 And the sons of Judah were Perez and Zerah by Tamar
 and the son of Perez was Hezron
 and the son of Hezron was Ram
 And the son of Ram was Amminadab
 and the son of Amminadab was Nahshon
 and the son of Nahshon was Salmon
 And the son of Salmon by Rahab was Boaz
 and the son of Boaz by Ruth was Obed
 and the son of Obed was Jesse
 And the son of Jesse was David the king
 and the son of David was Solomon by her who had been the w*e of Uriah
 And the son of Solomon was Rehoboam
 and the son of Rehoboam was Abijah
 and the son of Abijah was Asa
 And the son of Asa was Jehoshaphat
 and the son of Jehoshaphat was Joram
 and the son of Joram was Uzziah
 And the son of Uzziah was Jotham
 and the son of Jotham was Ahaz
 and the son of Ahaz was Hezekiah
 And the son of Hezekiah was Manasseh
 and the son of Manasseh was Amon
 and the son of Amon was Josiah
 And the sons of Josiah were Jechoniah and his brothers
 at the time of the taking away to Babylon.
 And after the taking away to Babylon
 Jechoniah had a son Shealtiel
 and Shealtiel had Zerubbabel
 And Zerubbabel had Abiud
 and Abiud had Eliakim
 and Eliakim had Azor
 And Azor had Zadok
 and Zadok had Achim
 and Achim had Eliud
 And Eliud had Eleazar
 and Eleazar had Matthan
 and Matthan had Jacob
 And the son of Jacob was Joseph the husband of Mary
 who gave birth to Jesus
 whose name is Christ.
 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations
 and from David to the taking away to Babylon
 fourteen generations
 and from the taking away to Babylon to the coming of Christ
 fourteen generations.
 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this way
 when his mother Mary was going to be married to Joseph
 before they came together the discovery was made that she was with child by the Holy Spirit.
 And Joseph
 her husband
 being an upright man
 and not desiring to make her a public example
 had a mind to put her away privately.
 But when he was giving thought to these things
 an angel of the Lord came to him in a dream
 saying
 Joseph
 son of David
 have no fear of taking Mary as your w*e
 because that which is in her body is of the Holy Spirit.
 And she will give birth to a son
 and you will give him the name Jesus
 for he will give his people salvation from their sins.
 Now all this took place so that the word of the Lord by the prophet might come true
 See
 the virgin will be with child
 and will give birth to a son
 and they will give him the name Immanuel
 that is
 God with us.
 And Joseph did as the angel of the Lord had said to him
 and took her as his w*e
 And he had no connection with her till she had given birth to a son
 and he gave him the name Jesus.
 Now when the birth of Jesus took place in Beth-lehem of Judaea
 in the days of Herod the king
 there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem
 Saying
 Where is the King of the Jews whose birth has now taken place? We have seen his star in the east and have come to give him worship.
 And when it came to the ears of Herod the king
 he was troubled
 and all Jerusalem with him.
 And he got together all the chief priests and scribes of the people
 questioning them as to where the birth-place of the Christ would be.
 And they said to him
 In Beth-lehem of Judaea
 for so it is said in the writings of the prophet
 You Beth-lehem
 in the land of Judah
 are not the least among the chiefs of Judah
 out of you will come a ruler
 who will be the keeper of my people Israel.
 Then Herod sent for the wise men privately
 and put questions to them about what time the star had been seen.
 And he sent them to Beth-lehem and said
 Go and make certain where the young child is
 and when you have seen him
 let me have news of it
 so that I may come and give him worship.
 And after hearing the king
 they went on their way
 and the star which they saw in the east went before them
 till it came to rest over the place where the young child was.
 And when they saw the star they were full of joy.
 And they came into the house
 and saw the young child with Mary
 his mother
 and falling down on their faces they gave him worship
 and from their store they gave him offerings of gold
 perfume
 and spices.
 And it was made clear to them by God in a dream that they were not to go back to Herod
 so they went into their country by another way.
 And when they had gone
 an angel of the Lord came to Joseph in a dream
 saying
 Get up and take the young child and his mother
 and go into Egypt
 and do not go from there till I give you word
 for Herod will be searching for the young child to put him to death.
 So he took the young child and his mother by night
 and went into Egypt
 And was there till the death of Herod
 so that the word of the Lord through the prophet might come true
 Out of Egypt have I sent for my son.
 Then Herod
 when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men
 was very angry
 and he sent out
 and put to death all the male children in Beth-lehem and in all the parts round about it
 from two years old and under
 acting on the knowledge which he had got with care from the wise men.
 Then the word of Jeremiah the prophet came true
 In Ramah there was a sound of weeping and great sorrow
 Rachel weeping for her children
 and she would not be comforted for their loss.
 But when Herod was dead
 an angel of the Lord came in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
 Saying
 Get up and take the young child and his mother
 and go into the land of Israel
 because they who were attempting to take the young child's l*e are dead.
 And he got up
 and took the young child and his mother
 and came into the land of Israel.
 But when it came to his ears that Archelaus was ruling over Judaea in the place of his father Herod
 he was in fear of going there
 and God having given him news of the danger in a dream
 he went out of the way into the country parts of Galilee.
 And he came and was living in a town named Nazareth
 so that the word of the prophets might come true
 He will be named a Nazarene.
 And in those days John the Baptist came preaching in the waste land of Judaea
 Saying
 Let your hearts be turned from sin
 for the kingdom of heaven is near.
 For this is he of whom Isaiah the prophet said
 The voice of one crying in the waste land
 Make ready the way of the Lord
 make his roads straight.
 Now John was clothed in camel's hair
 with a leather band about him
 and his food was locusts and honey.
 Then Jerusalem and all Judaea went out to him
 and all the people from near Jordan
 And they were given baptism by him in the river Jordan
 saying openly that they had done *.
 But when he saw a number of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism
 he said to them
 Offspring of snakes
 at whose word are you going in flight from the wrath to come?
 Let your change of heart be seen in your works
 And say not to yourselves
 We have Abraham for our father
 because I say to you that God is able from these stones to make children for Abraham.
 And even now the axe is put to the root of the trees
 every tree then which does not give good fruit is cut down
 and put into the fire.
 Truly
 I give baptism with water to those of you whose hearts are changed
 but he who comes after me is greater than I
 whose shoes I am not good enough to take up
 he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit and with fire
 In whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain
 he will put the good grain in his store
 but the waste will be burned up in the fire which will never be put out.
 Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan
 to be given baptism by him.
 But John would have kept him back
 saying
 It is I who have need of baptism from you
 and do you come to me?
 But Jesus made answer
 saying to him
 Let it be so now
 because so it is right for us to make righteousness complete. Then he gave him baptism.
 And Jesus
 having been given baptism
 straight away went up from the water
 and
 the heavens opening
 he saw the Spirit of God coming down on him as a dove
 And a voice came out of heaven
 saying
 This is my dearly loved Son
 with whom I am well pleased.
 Then Jesus was sent by the Spirit into the waste land to be tested by the Evil One.
 And after going without food for forty days and forty nights
 he was in need of it.
 And the Evil One came and said to him
 If you are the Son of God
 give the word for these stones to become bread.
 But he made answer and said
 It is in the Writings
 Bread is not man's only need
 but every word which comes out of the mouth of God.
 Then the Evil One took him to the holy town
 and he put him on the highest point of the Temple and said to him
 If you are the Son of God
 let yourself go down
 for it is in the Writings
 He will give his angels care over you
 and
 In their hands they will keep you up
 so that your foot may not be crushed against a stone.
 Jesus said to him
 Again it is in the Writings
 You may not put the Lord your God to the test.
 Again
 the Evil One took him up to a very high mountain
 and let him see all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them
 And he said to him
 All these things will I give you
 * you will go down on your face and give me worship.
 Then said Jesus to him
 Away
 Satan
 for it is in the Writings
 Give worship to the Lord your God and be his servant only.
 Then the Evil One went away from him
 and angels came and took care of him.
 Now when it came to his ears that John had been put in prison
 he went away to Galilee
 And going away from Nazareth
 he came and made his living-place in Capernaum
 which is by the sea
 in the country of Zebulun and Naphtali
 So that the word of the prophet Isaiah might come true
 The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali
 by the way of the sea
 the other side of Jordan
 Galilee of the Gentiles
 The people who were in the dark saw a great light
 and to those in the land of the shade of death did the dawn come up.
 From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying
 Let your hearts be turned from sin
 for the kingdom of heaven is near.
 And when he was walking by the sea of Galilee
 he saw two brothers
 Simon
 whose other name was Peter
 and Andrew
 his brother
 who were putting a net into the sea
 for they were fishermen.
 And he said to them
 Come after me
 and I will make you fishers of men.
 And straight away they let go the nets and went after him.
 And going on from there he saw two other brothers
 James
 the son of Zebedee
 and John
 his brother
 in the boat with their father
 stitching up their nets
 and he said
 Come.
 And they went straight from the boat and their father and came after him.
 And Jesus went about in all Galilee
 teaching in their Synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom
 and making well those who were ill with any disease among the people.
 And news of him went out through all Syria
 and they took to him all who were ill with d*ferent diseases and pains
 those having evil spirits and those who were off their heads
 and those who had no power of moving. And he made them well.
 And there went after him great numbers from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and from the other side of Jordan.
 And seeing great masses of people he went up into the mountain
 and when he was seated his disciples came to him.
 And with these words he gave them teaching
 saying
 Happy are the * in spirit
 for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
 Happy are those who are sad
 for they will be comforted.
 Happy are the gentle
 for the earth will be their heritage.
 Happy are those whose heart's desire is for righteousness
 for they will have their desire.
 Happy are those who have mercy
 for they will be given mercy.
 Happy are the clean in heart
 for they will see God.
 Happy are the peacemakers
 for they will be named sons of God.
 Happy are those who are attacked on account of righteousness
 for the kingdom of heaven will be theirs.
 Happy are you when men give you a * name
 and are cruel to you
 and say all evil things against you falsely
 because of me.
 Be glad and full of joy
 for great is your reward in heaven
 for so were the prophets attacked who were before you.
 You are the salt of the earth
 but * its taste goes from the salt
 how will you make it salt again? it is then good for nothing but to be put out and crushed under foot by men.
 You are the light of the world. A town put on a hill may be seen by all.
 And a burning light is not put under a vessel
 but on its table
 so that its rays may be shining on all who are in the house.
 Even so let your light be shining before men
 so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.
 Let there be no thought that I have come to put an end to the law or the prophets. I have not come for destruction
 but to make complete.
 Truly I say to you
 Till heaven and earth come to an end
 not the smallest letter or part of a letter will in any way be taken from the law
 till all things are done.
 Whoever then goes against the smallest of these laws
 teaching men to do the same
 will be named least in the kingdom of heaven
 but he who keeps the laws
 teaching others to keep them
 will be named great in the kingdom of heaven.
 For I say to you
 If your righteousness is not greater than the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees
 you will never go into the kingdom of heaven.
 You have knowledge that it was said in old times
 You may not put to death
 and
 Whoever puts to death will be in danger of being judged
 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be in danger of being judged
 and he who says to his brother
 Raca
 will be in danger from the Sanhedrin
 and whoever says
 You foolish one
 will be in danger of the hell of fire.
 If then you are making an offering at the altar and there it comes to your mind that your brother has something against you
 While your offering is still before the altar
 first go and make peace with your brother
 then come and make your offering.
 Come to an agreement quickly with him who has a cause against you at law
 while you are with him on the way
 for fear that he may give you up to the judge and the judge may give you to the police and you may be put into prison.
 Truly I say to you
 You will not come out from there till you have made payment of the very last farthing.
 You have knowledge that it was said
 You may not have connection with another man's w*e
 But I say to you that everyone whose eyes are turned on a woman with desire has had connection with her in his heart.
 And * your right eye is a cause of trouble to you
 take it out and put it away from you
 because it is better to undergo the loss of one part
 than for all your body to go into hell.
 And * your right hand is a cause of trouble to you
 let it be cut off and put it away from you
 because it is better to undergo the loss of one part
 than for all your body to go into hell.
 Again
 it was said
 Whoever puts away his w*e has to give her a statement in writing for this purpose
 But I say to you that everyone who puts away his w*e for any other cause but the loss of her virtue
 makes her false to her husband
 and whoever takes her as his w*e after she is put away
 is no true husband to her.
 Again
 you have knowledge that it was said in old times
 Do not take false oaths
 but give effect to your oaths to the Lord
 But I say to you
 Take no oaths at all
 not by the heaven
 because it is the seat of God
 Or by the earth
 because it is the resting-place for his foot
 or by Jerusalem
 because it is the town of the great King.
 You may not take an oath by your head
 because you are not able to make one hair white or black.
 But let your words be simply
 Yes or No
 and whatever is more than these is of the Evil One.
 You have knowledge that it was said
 An eye for an eye
 and a tooth for a tooth
 But I say to you
 Do not make use of force against an evil man
 but to him who gives you a blow on the right side of your face let the left be turned.
 And * any man goes to law with you and takes away your coat
 do not keep back your robe from him.
 And whoever makes you go one mile
 go with him two.
 Give to him who comes with a request
 and keep not your property from him who would for a time make use of it.
 You have knowledge that it was said
 Have love for your neighbour
 and hate for him who is against you
 But I say to you
 Have love for those who are against you
 and make prayer for those who are cruel to you
 So that you may be the sons of your Father in heaven
 for his sun gives light to the evil and to the good
 and he sends rain on the upright man and on the sinner.
 For * you have love for those who have love for you
 what credit is it to you? do not the tax-farmers the same?
 And * you say
 Good day
 to your brothers only
 what do you do more than others? do not even the Gentiles the same?
 Be then complete in righteousness
 even as your Father in heaven is complete.
 Take care not to do your good works before men
 to be seen by them
 or you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
 When then you give money to the *
 do not make a noise about it
 as the false-hearted men do in the Synagogues and in the streets
 so that they may have glory from men. Truly
 I say to you
 They have their reward.
 But when you give money
 let not your left hand see what your right hand does
 So that your giving may be in secret
 and your Father
 who sees in secret
 will give you your reward.
 And when you make your prayers
 be not like the false-hearted men
 who take pleasure in getting up and saying their prayers in the Synagogues and at the street turnings so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you
 They have their reward.
 But when you make your prayer
 go into your private room
 and
 shutting the door
 say a prayer to your Father in secret
 and your Father
 who sees in secret
 will give you your reward.
 And in your prayer do not make use of the same words again and again
 as the Gentiles do
 for they have the idea that God will give attention to them because of the number of their words.
 So be not like them
 because your Father has knowledge of your needs even before you make your requests to him.
 Let this then be your prayer
 Our Father in heaven
 may your name be kept holy.
 Let your kingdom come. Let your pleasure be done
 as in heaven
 so on earth.
 Give us this day bread for our needs.
 And make us free of our debts
 as we have made those free who are in debt to us.
 And let us not be put to the test
 but keep us safe from the Evil One.
 For * you let men have forgiveness for their sins
 you will have forgiveness from your Father in heaven.
 But * you do not let men have forgiveness for their sins
 you will not have forgiveness from your Father for your sins.
 And when you go without food
 be not sad-faced as the false-hearted are. For they go about with changed looks
 so that men may see that they are going without food. Truly I say to you
 They have their reward.
 But when you go without food
 put oil on your head and make your face clean
 So that no one may see that you are going without food
 but your Father in secret
 and your Father
 who sees in secret
 will give you your reward.
 Make no store of wealth for yourselves on earth
 where it may be turned to dust by worms and weather
 and where thieves may come in by force and take it away.
 But make a store for yourselves in heaven
 where it will not be turned to dust and where thieves do not come in to take it away
 For where your wealth is
 there will your heart be.
 The light of the body is the eye
 * then your eye is true
 all your body will be full of light.
 But * your eye is evil
 all your body will be dark. If then the light which is in you is dark
 how dark it will be!
 No man is able to be a servant to two masters
 for he will have hate for the one and love for the other
 or he will keep to one and have no respect for the other. You may not be servants of God and of wealth.
 So I say to you
 Take no thought for your l*e
 about food or drink
 or about clothing for your body. Is not l*e more than food
 and the body more than its clothing?
 See the birds of heaven
 they do not put seeds in the earth
 they do not get in grain
 or put it in store-houses
 and your Father in heaven gives them food. Are you not of much more value than they?
 And which of you by taking thought is able to make himself a cubit taller?
 And why are you troubled about clothing? See the flowers of the field
 how they come up
 they do no work
 they make no thread
 But I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these.
 But * God gives such clothing to the grass of the field
 which is here today and tomorrow is put into the oven
 will he not much more give you clothing
 O you of little faith?
 Then do not be full of care
 saying
 What are we to have for food or drink? or
 With what may we be clothed?
 Because the Gentiles go in search of all these things
 for your Father in heaven has knowledge that you have need of all these things
 But let your first care be for his kingdom and his righteousness
 and all these other things will be given to you in addition.
 Then have no care for tomorrow
 tomorrow will take care of itself. Take the trouble of the day as it comes.
 Be not judges of others
 and you will not be judged.
 For as you have been judging
 so you will be judged
 and with your measure will it be measured to you.
 And why do you take note of the grain of dust in your brother's eye
 but take no note of the bit of wood which is in your eye?
 Or how will you say to your brother
 Let me take out the grain of dust from your eye
 when you yourself have a bit of wood in your eye?
 You false one
 first take out the bit of wood from your eye
 then will you see clearly to take out the grain of dust from your brother's eye.
 Do not give that which is holy to the dogs
 or put your jewels before pigs
 for fear that they will be crushed under foot by the pigs whose attack will then be made against you.
 Make a request
 and it will be answered
 what you are searching for you will get
 give the sign
 and the door will be open to you
 Because to everyone who makes a request
 it will be given
 and he who is searching will get his desire
 and to him who gives the sign
 the door will be open.
 Or which of you
 * his son makes a request for bread
 will give him a stone?
 Or * he makes a request for a fish
 will give him a snake?
 If you
 then
 being evil
 are able to give good things to your children
 how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who make requests to him?
 All those things
 then
 which you would have men do to you
 even so do you to them
 because this is the law and the prophets.
 Go in by the narrow door
 for wide is the door and open is the way which goes to destruction
 and great numbers go in by it.
 For narrow is the door and hard the road to l*e
 and only a small number make discovery of it.
 Be on the watch for false prophets
 who come to you in sheep's clothing
 but inside they are cruel wolves.
 By their fruits you will get knowledge of them. Do men get grapes from thorns or figs from thistles?
 Even so
 every good tree gives good fruit
 but the * tree gives evil fruit.
 It is not possible for a good tree to give * fruit
 and a * tree will not give good fruit.
 Every tree which does not give good fruit is cut down and put in the fire.
 So by their fruits you will get knowledge of them.
 Not everyone who says to me
 Lord
 Lord
 will go into the kingdom of heaven
 but he who does the pleasure of my Father in heaven.
 A great number will say to me on that day
 Lord
 Lord
 were we not prophets in your name
 and did we not by your name send out evil spirits
 and by your name do works of power?
 And then will I say to them
 I never had knowledge of you
 go from me
 you workers of evil.
 Everyone
 then
 to whom my words come and who does them
 will be like a wise man who made his house on a rock
 And the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house
 but it was not moved
 because it was based on the rock.
 And everyone to whom my words come and who does them not
 will be like a foolish man who made his house on sand
 And the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house
 and it came down and great was its fall.
 And it came about
 when Jesus had come to the end of these words
 that the people were surprised at his teaching
 for he was teaching as one having authority
 and not as their scribes.
 And when he had come down from the mountain
 great numbers of people came after him.
 And a leper came and gave him worship
 saying
 Lord
 * it is your pleasure
 you have power to make me clean.
 And he put his hand on him
 saying
 It is my pleasure
 be clean. And straight away he was made clean.
 And Jesus said to him
 See that you say nothing about this to anyone
 but go and let the priest see you and make the offering which was ordered by Moses
 for a witness to them.
 And when Jesus was come into Capernaum
 a certain captain came to him with a request
 Saying
 Lord
 my servant is ill in bed at the house
 with no power in his body
 and in great pain.
 And he said to him
 I will come and make him well.
 And the captain in answer said
 Lord
 I am not good enough for you to come under my roof
 but only say the word
 and my servant will be made well.
 Because I myself am a man under authority
 having under me fighting men
 and I say to this one
 Go
 and he goes
 and to another
 Come
 and he comes
 and to my servant
 Do this
 and he does it.
 And when these words came to the ears of Jesus he was surprised
 and said to those who came after him
 Truly I say to you
 I have not seen such great faith
 no
 not in Israel.
 And I say to you that numbers will come from the east and the west
 and will take their seats with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob
 in the kingdom of heaven
 But the sons of the kingdom will be put out into the dark
 and there will be weeping and cries of pain.
 And Jesus said to the captain
 Go in peace
 as your faith is
 so let it be done to you. And the servant was made well in that hour.
 And when Jesus had come into Peter's house
 he saw his w*e's mother in bed
 very ill.
 And he put his hand on hers and the disease went from her
 and she got up and took care of his needs.
 And in the evening
 they took to him a number of people who had evil spirits
 and he sent the spirits out of them with a word
 and made well all who were ill
 So that the word of Isaiah the prophet might come true
 He himself took our pains and our diseases.
 Now when Jesus saw a great mass of people about him
 he gave an order to go to the other side.
 And there came a scribe and said to him
 Master
 I will come after you wherever you go.
 And Jesus said to him
 The foxes have holes
 and the birds of heaven have a resting-place
 but the Son of man has nowhere to put his head.
 And another of the disciples said to him
 Lord
 let me first go and give the last honours to my father.
 But Jesus said to him
 Come after me
 and let the dead take care of their dead.
 And when he had got into a boat
 his disciples went after him.
 And there came up a great storm in the sea
 so that the boat was covered with the waves
 but he was sleeping.
 And they came to him
 and
 awaking him
 said
 Help
 Lord
 destruction is near.
 And he said to them
 Why are you full of fear
 O you of little faith? Then he got up and gave orders to the winds and the sea
 and there was a great calm.
 And the men were full of wonder
 saying
 What sort of man is this
 that even the winds and the sea do his orders?
 And when he had come to the other side
 to the country of the Gadarenes
 there came out to him from the place of the dead
 two who had evil spirits
 so violent that no man was able to go that way.
 And they gave a loud cry
 saying
 What have we to do with you
 you Son of God? Have you come here to give us punishment before the time?
 Now there was
 some distance away
 a great herd of pigs taking their food.
 And the evil spirits made strong prayers to him
 saying
 If you send us out
 let us go into the herd of pigs.
 And he said to them
 Go. And they came out
 and went into the pigs
 and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea and came to their end in the water.
 And their keepers went in flight to the town and gave an account of everything
 and of the men who had the evil spirits.
 And all the town came out to Jesus
 and seeing him they made request that he would go away from their part of the country.
 And he got into a boat and went across and came to his town.
 And they took to him a man stretched on a bed who had no power of moving
 and Jesus
 seeing their faith
 said to the man who was ill
 Son
 take heart
 you have forgiveness for your sins.
 And some of the scribes said among themselves
 This man has no respect for God.
 And Jesus
 having knowledge of what was in their minds
 said
 Why are your thoughts evil?
 For which is the simpler
 to say
 You have forgiveness for your sins
 or to say
 Get up and go?
 But so that you may see that on earth the Son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins
 (then said he to the man who was ill
) Get up
 and take up your bed
 and go to your house.
 And he got up and went away to his house.
 But when the people saw it they were full of fear
 and gave glory to God who had given such authority to men.
 And when Jesus was going from there
 he saw a man whose name was Matthew
 seated at the place where taxes were taken
 and he said to him
 Come after me. And he got up and went after him.
 And it came about
 when he was in the house taking food
 that a number of tax-farmers and sinners came and took their places with Jesus and his disciples.
 And when the Pharisees saw it
 they said to his disciples
 Why does your Master take food with tax-farmers and sinners?
 But on hearing this he said
 Those who are well have no need of a medical man
 but those who are ill.
 But go and take to heart the sense of these words
 My desire is for mercy
 not offerings
 for I have come not to get the upright
 but sinners.
 Then the disciples of John came to him
 saying
 Why do we and the Pharisees frequently go without food
 but your disciples do not?
 And Jesus said to them
 Will the friends of the newly-married man be sad as long as he is with them? But the days will come when he will be taken away from them
 and then will they go without food.
 And no man puts a bit of new cloth on an old coat
 for by pulling away from the old
 it makes a worse hole.
 And men do not put new wine into old wine-skins
 or the skins will be burst and the wine will come out
 and the skins are of no more use
 but they put new wine into new wine-skins
 and so the two will be safe.
 While he was saying these things to them
 there came a ruler and gave him worship
 saying
 My daughter is even now dead
 but come and put your hand on her
 and she will come back to l*e.
 And Jesus got up and went after him
 and so did his disciples.
 And a woman
 who for twelve years had had a flow of blood
 came after him
 and put her hand on the edge of his robe
 Because
 she said to herself
 * I may but put my hand on his robe
 I will be made well.
 But Jesus
 turning and seeing her
 said
 Daughter
 take heart
 your faith has made you well. And the woman was made well from that hour.
 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house and saw the players with their instruments and the people making a noise
 He said
 Make room
 for the girl is not dead
 but sleeping. And they were laughing at him.
 But when the people were sent out
 he went in and took her by the hand
 and the girl got up.
 And the news of it went out into all that land.
 And when Jesus went on from there
 two blind men came after him
 crying out
 Have mercy on us
 you Son of David.
 And when he had come into the house
 the blind men came to him
 and Jesus said to them
 Have you faith that I am able to do this? They said to him
 Yes
 Lord.
 Then he put his hand on their eyes
 saying
 As your faith is
 let it be done to you.
 And their eyes were made open. And Jesus said to them sharply
 Let no man have knowledge of it.
 But they went out and gave news of him in all that land.
 And while they were going away
 there came to him a man without the power of talking
 and with an evil spirit.
 And when the evil spirit had been sent out
 the man had the power of talking
 and they were all surprised
 saying
 Such a thing has never been seen in Israel.
 But the Pharisees said
 By the ruler of evil spirits
 he sends evil spirits out of men.
 And Jesus went about all the towns and small places
 teaching in their Synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and making well all sorts of disease and pain.
 But when he saw all the people he was moved with pity for them
 because they were troubled and wandering like sheep without a keeper.
 Then he said to his disciples
 There is much grain but not enough men to get it in.
 Make prayer
 then
 to the Lord of the grain-fields
 that he may send out workers to get in his grain.
 And he got together his twelve disciples and gave them the power of driving out unclean spirits
 and of making well all sorts of disease and pain.
 Now the names of the twelve are these
 The first
 Simon
 who is named Peter
 and Andrew
 his brother
 James
 the son of Zebedee
 and John
 his brother
 Philip and Bartholomew
 Thomas and Matthew
 the tax-farmer
 James
 the son of Alphaeus
 and Thaddaeus
 Simon the Zealot
 and Judas Iscariot
 who was false to him.
 These twelve Jesus sent out and gave them orders
 saying
 Do not go among the Gentiles
 or into any town of Samaria
 But go to the wandering sheep of the house of Israel
 And
 on your way
 say
 The kingdom of heaven is near.
 Make well those who are ill
 give l*e to the dead
 make lepers clean
 send evil spirits out of men
 freely it has been given to you
 freely give.
 Take no gold or silver or copper in your pockets
 Take no bag for your journey and do not take two coats or shoes or a stick
 for the workman has a right to his food.
 And into whatever town or small place you go
 make search there for someone who is respected
 and make his house your resting-place till you go away.
 And when you go in
 say
 May peace be on this house.
 And * the house is good enough
 let your peace come on it
 but * not
 let your peace come back to you.
 And whoever will not take you in
 or give ear to your words
 when you go out from that house or that town
 put off its dust from your feet.
 Truly I say to you
 It will be better for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of God's judging than for that town.
 See
 I send you out as sheep among wolves. Be then as wise as snakes
 and as gentle as doves.
 But be on the watch against men
 for they will give you up to the Sanhedrins
 and in their Synagogues they will give you blows
 And you will come before rulers and kings because of me
 for a witness to them and to the Gentiles.
 But when you are given up into their hands
 do not be troubled about what to say or how to say it
 for in that hour what you are to say will be given to you
 Because it is not you who say the words
 but the Spirit of your Father in you.
 And brother will give up brother to death
 and the father his child
 and children will go against their fathers and mothers
 and put them to death.
 And you will be hated by all men because of my name
 but he who is strong to the end will have salvation.
 But when they are cruel to you in one town
 go in flight to another
 for truly
 I say to you
 You will not have gone through the towns of Israel before the Son of man comes.
 A disciple is not greater than his master
 or a servant than his lord.
 It is enough for the disciple that he may be as his master
 and the servant as his lord. If they have given the name Beelzebub to the master of the house
 how much more to those of his house!
 Have
 then
 no fear of them
 because nothing is covered which will not come to light
 or secret which will not be made clear.
 What I say to you in the dark
 say in the light
 and what comes to your ear secretly
 say publicly from the house-tops.
 And have no fear of those who put to death the body
 but are not able to put to death the soul. But have fear of him who has power to give soul and body to destruction in hell.
 Are not sparrows two a farthing? and not one of them comes to an end without your Father
 But the hairs of your head are all numbered.
 Then have no fear
 you are of more value than a flock of sparrows.
 To everyone
 then
 who gives witness to me before men
 I will give witness before my Father in heaven.
 But * anyone says before men that he has no knowledge of me
 I will say that I have no knowledge of him before my Father in heaven.
 Do not have the thought that I have come to send peace on the earth
 I came not to send peace but a sword.
 For I have come to put a man against his father
 and the daughter against her mother
 and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law
 And a man will be hated by those of his house.
 He who has more love for his father or mother than for me is not good enough for me
 he who has more love for son or daughter than for me is not good enough for me.
 And he who does not take his cross and come after me is not good enough for me.
 He who has the desire to keep his l*e will have it taken from him
 and he who gives up his l*e because of me will have it given back to him.
 He who gives honour to you gives honour to me
 and he who gives honour to me gives honour to him who sent me.
 He who gives honour to a prophet
 in the name of a prophet
 will be given a prophet's reward
 and he who gives honour to an upright man
 in the name of an upright man
 will be given an upright man's reward.
 And whoever gives to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only
 in the name of a disciple
 truly I say to you
 he will not go without his reward.
 And it came about that when Jesus had come to the end of giving these orders to his twelve disciples
 he went away from there
 teaching and preaching in their towns.
 Now when John had news in prison of the works of the Christ
 he sent his disciples
 To say to him
 Are you he who is to come
 or are we waiting for another?
 And Jesus
 answering
 said to them
 Go and give news to John of the things which you are seeing and hearing
 The blind see
 those who were not able to
 are walking
 lepers are made clean
 those who were without hearing
 now have their ears open
 the dead come to l*e again
 and the * have the good news given to them.
 And a blessing will be on him who has no doubts about me.
 And when they were going away
 Jesus
 talking of John
 said to all the people
 What went you out into the waste land to see? a tall stem moving in the wind?
 But what went you out to see? a man delicately clothed? Those who have fair robes are in kings' houses.
 But why did you go out? to see a prophet? Yes
 I say to you
 and more than a prophet.
 This is he of whom it has been said
 See
 I send my servant before your face
 who will make ready your way before you.
 Truly I say to you
 Among the sons of women there has not been a greater than John the Baptist
 but he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
 And from the days of John the Baptist till now
 the kingdom of heaven is forcing its way in
 and men of force take it.
 For all the prophets and the law were in force till John.
 And * you are able to see it
 this is Elijah who was to come.
 He who has ears
 let him give ear.
 But what comparison may I make of this generation? It is like children seated in the market-places
 crying out to one another
 We made music for you and you did not take part in the dance
 we gave cries of sorrow and you made no signs of grief.
 For John came
 taking no food or drink
 and they say
 He has an evil spirit.
 The Son of man has come feasting
 and they say
 See
 a lover of food and wine
 a friend of tax-farmers and sinners! And wisdom is judged to be right by her works.
 Then he went on to say hard things to the towns where most of his works of power were done
 because they had not been turned from their sins.
 Unhappy are you
 Chorazin! Unhappy are you
 Beth-saida! For * the works of power which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon
 they would have been turned from their sins in days gone by
 clothing themselves in haircloth and putting dust on their heads.
 But I say to you
 It will be better for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judging
 than for you.
 And you
 Capernaum
 were you not to be l*ted up to heaven? you will go down into hell
 for * the works of power which were done in you had been done in Sodom
 it would have been here to this day.
 But I say to you that it will be better for the land of Sodom in the day of judging
 than for you.
 At that time Jesus made answer and said
 I give praise to you
 O Father
 Lord of heaven and earth
 because you have kept these things secret from the wise and the men of learning
 and have made them clear to little children.
 Yes
 Father
 for so it was pleasing in your eyes.
 All things have been given to me by my Father
 and no one has knowledge of the Son
 but the Father
 and no one has knowledge of the Father
 but the Son
 and he to whom the Son will make it clear.
 Come to me
 all you who are troubled and weighted down with care
 and I will give you rest.
 Take my yoke on you and become like me
 for I am gentle and without pride
 and you will have rest for your souls
 For my yoke is good
 and the weight I take up is not hard.
 At that time Jesus went through the fields on the Sabbath day
 and his disciples
 being in need of food
 were taking the heads of grain.
 But the Pharisees
 when they saw it
 said to him
 See
 your disciples do that which it is not right to do on the Sabbath.
 But he said to them
 Have you no knowledge of what David did when he had need of food
 and those who were with him?
 How he went into the house of God and took for food the holy bread which it was not right for him or for those who were with him to take
 but only for the priests?
 Or is it not said in the law
 how the Sabbath is broken by the priests in the Temple and they do no *?
 But I say to you that a greater thing than the Temple is here.
 But * these words had been in your minds
 My desire is for mercy and not for offerings
 you would not have been judging those who have done no *.
 For the Son of man is lord of the Sabbath.
 And he went from there into their Synagogue
 And there was a man with a dead hand. And they put a question to him
 saying
 Is it right to make a man well on the Sabbath day? so that they might have something against him.
 And he said to them
 Which of you
 having a sheep
 * it gets into a hole on the Sabbath day
 will not put out a helping hand and get it back?
 Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! For this reason it is right to do good on the Sabbath day.
 Then said he to the man
 Put out your hand. And he put it out
 and it was made as well as the other.
 But the Pharisees went out and made designs against him
 how they might put him to death.
 And Jesus
 having knowledge of this
 went away from there
 and a great number went after him
 and he made them all well
 Ordering them not to give people word of him
 So that what was said by Isaiah the prophet might come true
 See my servant
 the man of my selection
 my loved one in whom my soul is well pleased
 I will put my Spirit on him
 and he will make my decision clear to the Gentiles.
 His coming will not be with fighting or loud cries
 and his voice will not be l*ted up in the streets.
 The crushed stem will not be broken by him
 and the feebly burning light will he not put out
 till he has made righteousness overcome all.
 And in his name will the Gentiles put their hope.
 Then they took to him one with an evil spirit
 who was blind and had no power of talking
 and he made him well so that he had the power of talking and seeing.
 And all the people were surprised and said
 Is not this the Son of David?
 But the Pharisees
 hearing of it
 said
 This man only sends evil spirits out of men by Beelzebub
 the ruler of evil spirits.
 And having knowledge of their thoughts he said to them
 Every kingdom having division in itself is made waste
 and every town or house having division in itself will come to destruction.
 And * Satan sends out Satan
 he makes war against himself
 how then will he keep his kingdom?
 And * I by Beelzebub send evil spirits out of men
 by whom do your sons send them out? So let them be your judges.
 But * I by the Spirit of God send out evil spirits
 then is the kingdom of God come on you.
 Or how may one go into a strong man's house and take his goods
 * he does not first put cords round the strong man? and then he may take his goods.
 Whoever is not with me is against me
 and he who does not take part with me in getting people together
 is driving them away.
 So I say to you
 Every sin and every evil word against God will have forgiveness
 but for evil words against the Spirit there will be no forgiveness.
 And whoever says a word against the Son of man
 will have forgiveness
 but whoever says a word against the Holy Spirit
 will not have forgiveness in this l*e or in that which is to come.
 Make the tree good
 and its fruit good
 or make the tree *
 and its fruit *
 for by its fruit you will get knowledge of the tree.
 You offspring of snakes
 how are you
 being evil
 able to say good things? because out of the heart's store come the words of the mouth.
 The good man out of his good store gives good things
 and the evil man out of his evil store gives evil things.
 And I say to you that in the day when they are judged
 men will have to give an account of every foolish word they have said.
 For by your words will your righteousness be seen
 and by your words you will be judged.
 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees
 hearing this
 said to him
 Master
 we are looking for a sign from you.
 But he
 answering
 said to them
 An evil and false generation is looking for a sign
 and no sign will be given to it but the sign of the prophet Jonah
 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the great fish
 so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
 The men of Nineveh will come up in the day of judging and give their decision against this generation
 because they were turned from their sins at the preaching of Jonah
 and now a greater than Jonah is here.
 The queen of the South will come up in the day of judging and give her decision against this generation
 for she came from the ends of the earth to give ear to the wisdom of Solomon
 and now a greater than Solomon is here.
 But the unclean spirit
 when he is gone out of a man
 goes through dry places looking for rest
 and getting it not.
 Then he says
 I will go back into my house from which I came out
 and when he comes
 he sees that there is no one in it
 but that it has been made fair and clean.
 Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits worse than himself
 and they go in and make it their living-place
 and the last condition of that man is worse than the first. Even so will it be with this evil generation.
 While he was still talking to the people
 his mother and his brothers came
 desiring to have talk with him.
 And one said to him
 See
 your mother and your brothers are outside
 desiring to have talk with you.
 But he in answer said to him who gave the news
 Who is my mother and who are my brothers?
 And he put out his hand to his disciples and said
 See
 my mother and my brothers!
 For whoever does the pleasure of my Father in heaven
 he is my brother
 and sister
 and mother.
 On that day Jesus went out of the house and was seated by the seaside.
 And great numbers of people came together to him
 so that he got into a boat
 and the people took up their position by the sea.
 And he gave them teaching in the form of a story
 saying
 A man went out to put seed in the earth
 And while he did so
 some seeds were dropped by the wayside
 and the birds came and took them for food
 And some of the seed went among the stones
 where it had not much earth
 and straight away it came up because the earth was not deep
 And when the sun was high
 it was burned
 and because it had no root it became dry and dead.
 And some seeds went among thorns
 and the thorns came up and they had no room for growth
 And some
 falling on good earth
 gave fruit
 some a hundred
 some sixty
 some thirty times as much.
 He who has ears
 let him give ear.
 And the disciples came and said to him
 Why do you say things to them in the form of stories?
 And he said to them in answer
 To you is given the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven
 but to them it is not given.
 Because whoever has
 to him will be given
 and he will have more
 but from him who has not
 even what he has will be taken away.
 For this reason I put things into the form of stories
 because they see without seeing
 and give ear without hearing
 and the sense is not clear to them.
 And for them the words of Isaiah have come true
 Though you give ear
 you will not get knowledge
 and seeing
 you will see
 but the sense will not be clear to you
 For the heart of this people has become fat and their ears are slow in hearing and their eyes are shut
 for fear that they might see with their eyes and give hearing with their ears and become wise in their hearts and be turned again to me
 so that I might make them well.
 But a blessing be on your eyes
 because they see
 and on your ears
 because they are open.
 For truly
 I say to you that prophets and upright men had a desire to see the things which you see
 and saw them not
 and to have knowledge of the words which have come to your ears
 and they had it not.
 Give ear
 then
 to the story of the man who put the seed in the earth.
 When the word of the kingdom comes to anyone
 and the sense of it is not clear to him
 then the Evil One comes
 and quickly takes away that which was put in his heart. He is the seed dropped by the wayside.
 And that which went on the stones
 this is he who
 hearing the word
 straight away takes it with joy
 But having no root in himself
 he goes on for a time
 and when trouble comes or pain
 because of the word
 he quickly becomes full of doubts.
 And that which was dropped among the thorns
 this is he who has the word
 and the cares of this l*e
 and the deceits of wealth
 put a stop to the growth of the word and it gives no fruit.
 And the seed which was put in good earth
 this is he who gives ear to the word
 and gets the sense of it
 who gives fruit
 some a hundred
 some sixty
 some thirty times as much.
 And he gave them another story
 saying
 The kingdom of heaven is like a man who put good seed in his field
 But while men were sleeping
 one who had hate for him came and put evil seeds among the grain
 and went away.
 But when the green stem came up and gave fruit
 the evil plants were seen at the same time.
 And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him
 Sir
 did you not put good seed in your field? how then has it evil plants?
 And he said
 Someone has done this in hate. And the servants say to him
 Is it your pleasure that we go and take them up?
 But he says
 No
 for fear that by chance while you take up the evil plants
 you may be rooting up the grain with them.
 Let them come up together till the getting in of the grain
 and then I will say to the workers
 Take up first the evil plants
 and put them together for burning
 but put the grain into my store-house.
 He put another story before them
 saying
 The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his field
 Which is smaller than all seeds
 but when it has come up it is greater than the plants
 and becomes a tree
 so that the birds of heaven come and make their resting-places in its branches.
 Another story he gave to them
 The kingdom of heaven is like leaven
 which a woman took
 and put in three measures of meal
 till it was all leavened.
 All these things Jesus said to the people in the form of stories
 and without a story he said nothing to them
 That it might come true which was said by the prophet
 Opening my mouth
 I will give out stories
 I will give knowledge of things kept secret from before all time.
 Then he went away from the people
 and went into the house
 and his disciples came to him
 saying
 Make clear to us the story of the evil plants in the field.
 And he made answer and said
 He who puts the good seed in the earth is the Son of man
 And the field is the world
 and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom
 and the evil seeds are the sons of the Evil One
 And he who put them in the earth is Satan
 and the getting in of the grain is the end of the world
 and those who get it in are the angels.
 As then the evil plants are got together and burned with fire
 so will it be in the end of the world.
 The Son of man will send out his angels
 and they will take out of his kingdom everything which is a cause of error
 and all those who do *
 And will put them into the fire
 there will be weeping and cries of sorrow.
 Then will the upright be shining as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears
 let him give ear.
 The kingdom of heaven is like a secret store of wealth in a field
 which a man came across and put back again
 and in his joy he goes and gives all he has
 to get that field.
 Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like a trader searching for beaut*ul jewels.
 And having come across one jewel of great price
 he went and gave all he had in exchange for it.
 Again
 the kingdom of heaven is like a net
 which was put into the sea and took in every sort of fish
 When it was full
 they took it up on the sands
 and seated there they put the good into vessels
 but the * they put away.
 So will it be in the end of the world
 the angels will come and take out the * from the good
 And will put them into the fire
 there will be weeping and cries of sorrow.
 Are all these things now clear to you? They say to him
 Yes.
 And he said to them
 For this reason every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house
 who gives out from his store things new and old.
 And when Jesus had come to the end of these stories he went away from there.
 And coming into his country
 he gave them teaching in their Synagogue
 so that they were greatly surprised and said
 Where did this man get this wisdom and these works of power?
 Is not this the woodworker's son? is not his mother named Mary? and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
 And his sisters
 are they not all with us? from where
 then
 has he all these things?
 And they were bitter against him. But Jesus said to them
 A prophet is nowhere without honour but in his country and among his family.
 And the works of power which he did there were small in number because they had no faith.
 At that time news of Jesus came to Herod the king
 And he said to his servants
 This is John the Baptist
 he has come back from the dead
 and so these powers are working in him.
 For Herod had taken John and put him in prison because of Herodias
 his brother Philip's w*e.
 Because John had said to him
 It is not right for you to have her.
 And he would have put him to death
 but for his fear of the people
 because in their eyes John was a prophet.
 But when Herod's birthday came
 the daughter of Herodias was dancing before them
 and Herod was pleased with her.
 So he gave her his word with an oath to let her have whatever she might make request for.
 And she
 at her mother's suggestion
 said
 Give me here on a plate the head of John the Baptist.
 And the king was sad
 but because of his oaths and because of his guests
 he gave the order for it to be given to her
 And he sent and had John's head cut off in the prison.
 And his head was put on a plate and given to the girl
 and she took it to her mother.
 And his disciples came
 and took up his body and put it in the earth
 and they went and gave Jesus news of what had taken place.
 Now when it came to the ears of Jesus
 he went away from there in a boat
 to a waste place by himself
 and the people hearing of it
 went after him on foot from the towns.
 And he came out and saw a great number of people and he had pity on them
 and made well those of them who were ill.
 And when evening had come
 the disciples came to him
 saying
 This place is waste land
 and the time is now past
 send the people away so that they may go into the towns and get themselves food.
 But Jesus said to them
 There is no need for them to go away
 give them food yourselves.
 And they say to him
 We have here but five cakes of bread and two fishes.
 And he said
 Give them to me.
 And he gave orders for the people to be seated on the grass
 and he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and
 looking up to heaven
 he said words of blessing
 and made division of the food
 and gave it to the disciples
 and the disciples gave it to the people.
 And they all took of the food and had enough
 and they took up twelve baskets full of broken bits which were not used.
 And those who had food were about five thousand men
 in addition to women and children.
 And straight away he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side
 till he had sent the people away.
 And after he had sent the people away
 he went up into the mountain by himself for prayer
 and when evening was come
 he was there by himself.
 But the boat was now in the middle of the sea
 and was troubled by the waves
 for the wind was against them.
 And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them
 walking on the sea.
 And when they saw him walking on the sea
 they were troubled
 saying
 It is a spirit
 and they gave cries of fear.
 But straight away Jesus said to them
 Take heart
 it is I
 have no fear.
 And Peter
 answering
 said to him
 Lord
 * it is you
 give me the order to come to you on the water.
 And he said
 Come. And Peter got out of the boat
 and walking on the water
 went to Jesus.
 But when he saw the wind he was in fear and
 starting to go down
 he gave a cry
 saying
 Help
 Lord.
 And straight away Jesus put out his hand and took a grip of him
 and said to him
 O man of little faith
 why were you in doubt?
 And when they had got into the boat
 the wind went down.
 And those who were in the boat gave him worship
 saying
 Truly you are the Son of God.
 And when they had gone across
 they came to land at Gennesaret.
 And when the men of that place had news of him
 they sent into all the country round about
 and took to him all who were ill
 With the request that they might only put their hands on the edge of his robe
 and all those who did so were made well.
 Then there came to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes
 saying
 Why do your disciples go against the teaching of the fathers? for they take food with unwashed hands.
 And in answer he said to them
 Why do you
 yourselves
 go against the word of God on account of the teaching which has been handed down to you?
 For God said
 Give honour to your father and mother
 and
 He who says evil of father or mother will be put to death.
 But you say
 If a man says to his father or his mother
 That by which you might have had profit from me is given to God
 There is no need for him to give honour to his father. And you have made the word of God without effect because of your teaching.
 You false ones
 well did Isaiah say of you
 These people give me honour with their lips
 but their heart is far from me.
 But their worship is to no purpose
 while they give as their teaching the rules of men.
 And he got the people together and said to them
 Give ear
 and let my words be clear to you
 Not that which goes into the mouth makes a man unclean
 but that which comes out of the mouth.
 Then the disciples came and said to him
 Did you see that the Pharisees were troubled when these words came to their ears?
 But he said in answer
 Every plant which my Father in heaven has not put in the earth
 will be taken up by the roots.
 Let them be
 they are blind guides. And * a blind man is guiding a blind man
 the two will go falling into a hole together.
 Then Peter said to him
 Make the story clear to us.
 And he said
 Are you
 like them
 still without wisdom?
 Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth goes on into the stomach
 and is sent out as waste?
 But the things which come out of the mouth come from the heart
 and they make a man unclean.
 For out of the heart come evil thoughts
 the taking of l*e
 broken faith between the married
 unclean desires of the flesh
 taking of property
 false witness
 bitter words
 These are the things which make a man unclean
 but to take food with unwashed hands does not make a man unclean.
 And Jesus went away from there into the country of Tyre and Sidon.
 And a woman of Canaan came out from those parts
 crying and saying
 Have pity on me
 O Lord
 Son of David
 my daughter is greatly troubled with an unclean spirit.
 But he gave her no answer. And his disciples came and said to him
 Send her away
 for she is crying after us.
 But he made answer and said
 I was sent only to the wandering sheep of the house of Israel.
 But she came and gave him worship
 saying
 Help
 Lord.
 And he made answer and said
 It is not right to take the children's bread and give it to the dogs.
 But she said
 Yes
 Lord
 but even the dogs take the bits from under their masters' table.
 Then Jesus
 answering
 said to her
 O woman
 great is your faith
 let your desire be done. And her daughter was made well from that hour.
 And Jesus went from there and came to the sea of Galilee
 and he went up into the mountain
 and took his seat there.
 And there came to him great numbers of people having with them those who were broken in body
 or blind
 or without voice
 or wounded
 or ill in any way
 and a number of others
 they put them down at his feet and he made them well
 So that the people were full of wonder when they saw that those who had no voice were talking
 the feeble were made strong
 those whose bodies were broken had the power of walking
 and the blind were able to see
 and they gave glory to the God of Israel.
 And Jesus got his disciples together and said
 I have pity for the people
 because they have now been with me three days and have no food
 and I will not send them away without food
 or they will have no strength for the journey.
 And the disciples say to him
 How may we get enough bread in a waste place
 to give food to such a number of people?
 And Jesus says to them
 How much bread have you? And they said
 Seven cakes
 and some small fishes.
 Then he gave an order to the people to be seated on the earth
 And he took the seven cakes of bread and the fishes
 and having given praise
 he gave the broken bread to the disciples
 and the disciples gave it to the people.
 And they all took food
 and had enough
 and they took up of the broken bits
 seven baskets full.
 And there were four thousand men who took food
 together with women and children.
 And when he had sent the people away
 he got into the boat
 and came into the country of Magadan.
 And the Pharisees and Sadducees came and
 testing him
 made a request to him to give them a sign from heaven.
 But in answer he said to them
 At nightfall you say
 The weather will be good
 for the sky is red.
 And in the morning
 The weather will be * today
 for the sky is red and angry. You are able to see the face of heaven
 but not the signs of the times.
 An evil and false generation is searching after a sign
 and no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah. And he went away from them.
 And when the disciples came to the other side they had not taken thought to get bread.
 And Jesus said to them
 Take care to have nothing to do with the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
 And they were reasoning among themselves
 saying
 We took no bread.
 And Jesus
 seeing it
 said
 O you of little faith
 why are you reasoning among yourselves
 because you have no bread?
 Do you still not see
 or keep in mind the five cakes of bread of the five thousand
 and the number of baskets you took up?
 Or the seven cakes of bread of the four thousand
 and the number of baskets you took up?
 How is it that you do not see that I was not talking to you about bread
 but about keeping away from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?
 Then they saw that it was not the leaven of bread which he had in mind
 but the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
 Now when Jesus had come into the parts of Caesarea Philippi
 he said
 questioning his disciples
 Who do men say that the Son of man is?
 And they said
 Some say
 John the Baptist
 some
 Elijah
 and others
 Jeremiah
 or one of the prophets.
 He says to them
 But who do you say that I am?
 And Simon Peter made answer and said
 You are the Christ
 the Son of the living God.
 And Jesus made answer and said to him
 A blessing on you
 Simon Bar-jonah
 because this knowledge has not come to you from flesh and blood
 but from my Father in heaven.
 And I say to you that you are Peter
 and on this rock will my church be based
 and the doors of hell will not overcome it.
 I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven
 and whatever is fixed by you on earth will be fixed in heaven
 and whatever you make free on earth will be made free in heaven.
 Then he gave orders to the disciples to give no man word that he was the Christ.
 From that time Jesus went on to make clear to his disciples how he would have to go up to Jerusalem
 and undergo much at the hands of those in authority and the chief priests and scribes
 and be put to death
 and the third day come again from the dead.
 And Peter
 protesting
 said to him
 Be it far from you
 Lord
 it is impossible that this will come about.
 But he
 turning to Peter
 said
 Get out of my way
 Satan
 you are a danger to me because your mind is not on the things of God
 but on the things of men.
 Then Jesus said to his disciples
 If any man would come after me
 let him give up all
 and take up his cross
 and come after me.
 Because whoever has a desire to keep his l*e safe will have it taken from him
 but whoever gives up his l*e because of me
 will have it given back to him.
 For what profit has a man
 * he gets all the world with the loss of his l*e? or what will a man give in exchange for his l*e?
 For the Son of man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels
 and then he will give to every man the reward of his works.
 Truly I say to you
 There are some of those here who will not have a taste of death
 till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
 And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter
 and James
 and John
 his brother
 and makes them go up with him into a high mountain by themselves.
 And he was changed in form before them
 and his face was shining like the sun
 and his clothing became white as light.
 And Moses and Elijah came before their eyes
 talking with him.
 And Peter made answer and said to Jesus
 Lord
 it is good for us to be here
 * you will let me
 I will make here three tents
 one for you
 and one for Moses
 and one for Elijah.
 While he was still talking
 a bright cloud came over them
 and a voice out of the cloud
 saying
 This is my dearly loved Son
 with whom I am well pleased
 give ear to him.
 And at these words the disciples went down on their faces in great fear.
 And Jesus came and put his hand on them and said
 Get up and have no fear.
 And l*ting up their eyes
 they saw no one
 but Jesus only.
 And when they were coming down from the mountain
 Jesus gave them orders
 saying
 Let no man have word of what you have seen
 till the Son of man has come again from the dead.
 And his disciples
 questioning him
 said
 Why then do the scribes say that Elijah has to come first?
 And in answer he said
 Elijah truly has to come and put all things right
 But I say to you that Elijah has come
 and they had no knowledge of him
 but did to him whatever they were pleased to do
 the same will the Son of man undergo at their hands.
 Then the disciples saw that he was talking to them of John the Baptist.
 And when they came to the people
 a man went down on his knees to him
 saying
 Lord have mercy on my son
 for he is off his head
 and is in great pain
 and frequently he goes falling into the fire
 and frequently into the water.
 And I took him to your disciples
 and they were not able to make him well.
 And Jesus
 answering
 said
 O false and foolish generation
 how long will I be with you? how long will I put up with you? let him come here to me.
 And Jesus gave orders to the unclean spirit
 and it went out of him
 and the boy was made well from that hour.
 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately
 and said
 Why were we not able to send it out?
 And he says to them
 Because of your little faith
 for truly I say to you
 If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed
 you will say to this mountain
 Be moved from this place to that
 and it will be moved
 and nothing will be impossible to you.
 []
 And while they were going about in Galilee
 Jesus said to them
 The Son of man will be given up into the hands of men
 And they will put him to death
 and the third day he will come again from the dead. And they were very sad.
 And when they had come to Capernaum
 those who took the Temple tax came to Peter and said
 Does not your master make payment of the Temple tax?
 He says
 Yes. And when he came into the house
 Jesus said to him
 What is your opinion
 Simon? from whom do the kings of the earth get payment or tax? from their sons or from other people?
 And when he said
 From other people
 Jesus said to him
 Then are the sons free.
 But
 so that we may not be a cause of trouble to them
 go to the sea
 and let down a hook
 and take the first fish which comes up
 and in his mouth you will see a bit of money
 take that
 and give it to them for me and you.
 In that hour the disciples came to Jesus
 saying
 Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
 And he took a little child
 and put him in the middle of them
 And said
 Truly
 I say to you
 If you do not have a change of heart and become like little children
 you will not go into the kingdom of heaven.
 Whoever
 then
 will make himself as low as this little child
 the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
 And whoever gives honour to one such little child in my name
 gives honour to me
 But whoever is a cause of trouble to one of these little ones who have faith in me
 it would be better for him to have a great stone fixed to his neck
 and to come to his end in the deep sea.
 A curse is on the earth because of trouble! for it is necessary for trouble to come
 but unhappy is that man through whom the trouble comes.
 And * your hand or your foot is a cause of trouble
 let it be cut off and put it away from you
 it is better for you to go into l*e with the loss of a hand or a foot than
 having two hands or two feet
 to go into the eternal fire.
 And * your eye is a cause of trouble to you
 take it out
 and put it away from you
 it is better for you to go into l*e with one eye than
 having two eyes
 to go into the hell of fire.
 Let it not seem to you that one of these little ones is of no value
 for I say to you that in heaven their angels see at all times the face of my Father in heaven.
 []
 What would you say now? * a man has a hundred sheep
 and one of them has gone wandering away
 will he not let the ninety-nine be
 and go to the mountains in search of the wandering one?
 And * he comes across it
 truly I say to you
 he has more joy over it than over the ninety-nine which have not gone out of the way.
 Even so it is not the pleasure of your Father in heaven for one of these little ones to come to destruction.
 And * your brother does * to you
 go
 make clear to him his error between you and him in private
 * he gives ear to you
 you have got your brother back again.
 But * he will not give ear to you
 take with you one or two more
 that by the lips of two or three witnesses every word may be made certain.
 And * he will not give ear to them
 let it come to the hearing of the church
 and * he will not give ear to the church
 let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax-farmer.
 Truly I say to you
 Whatever things are fixed by you on earth will be fixed in heaven
 and whatever you make free on earth will be made free in heaven.
 Again
 I say to you
 that * two of you are in agreement on earth about anything for which they will make a request
 it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
 For where two or three are come together in my name
 there am I among them.
 Then Peter came and said to him
 Lord
 what number of times may my brother do * against me
 and I give him forgiveness? till seven times?
 Jesus says to him
 I say not to you
 Till seven times
 but
 Till seventy times seven.
 For this reason the kingdom of heaven is like a king
 who went over his accounts with his servants.
 And at the start
 one came to him who was in his debt for ten thousand talents.
 And because he was not able to make payment
 his lord gave orders for him
 and his w*e
 and his sons and daughters
 and all he had
 to be given for money
 and payment to be made.
 So the servant went down on his face and gave him worship
 saying
 Lord
 give me time to make payment and I will give you all.
 And the lord of that servant
 being moved with pity
 let him go
 and made him free of the debt.
 But that servant went out
 and meeting one of the other servants
 who was in debt to him for one hundred pence
 he took him by the throat
 saying
 Make payment of your debt.
 So that servant went down on his face
 requesting him and saying
 Give me time and I will make payment to you.
 And he would not
 but went and put him into prison till he had made payment of the debt.
 So when the other servants saw what was done they were very sad
 and came and gave word to their lord of what had been done.
 Then his lord sent for him and said
 You evil servant
 I made you free of all that debt
 because of your request to me
 Was it not right for you to have mercy on the other servant
 even as I had mercy on you?
 And his lord was very angry
 and put him in the hands of those who would give him punishment till he made payment of all the debt.
 So will my Father in heaven do to you
 * you do not everyone
 from your hearts
 give forgiveness to his brother.
 And it came about that after saying these words
 Jesus went away from Galilee
 and came into the parts of Judaea on the other side of Jordan.
 And a great number went after him
 and he made them well there.
 And certain Pharisees came to him
 testing him
 and saying
 Is it right for a man to put away his w*e for every cause?
 And he said in answer
 Have you not seen in the Writings
 that he who made them at the first made them male and female
 and said
 For this cause will a man go away from his father and mother
 and be joined to his w*e
 and the two will become one flesh?
 So that they are no longer two
 but one flesh. Then let not that which has been joined by God be parted by man.
 They say to him
 Why then did Moses give orders that a husband might give her a statement in writing and be free from her?
 He says to them
 Moses
 because of your hard hearts
 let you put away your wives
 but it has not been so from the first.
 And I say to you
 Whoever puts away his w*e for any other cause than the loss of her virtue
 and takes another
 is a false husband
 and he who takes her as his w*e when she is put away
 is no true husband to her.
 The disciples say to him
 If this is the position of a man in relation to his w*e
 it is better not to be married.
 But he said to them
 Not all men are able to take in this saying
 but only those to whom it is given.
 For there are men who
 from birth
 were without sex
 and there are some who were made so by men
 and there are others who have made themselves so for the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to take it
 let him take it.
 Then some people took little children to him
 so that he might put his hands on them in blessing
 and the disciples said sharp words to them.
 But Jesus said
 Let the little ones come to me
 and do not keep them away
 for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
 And he put his hands on them
 and went away.
 And one came to him and said
 Master
 what good thing have I to do
 so that I may have eternal l*e?
 And he said to him
 Why are you questioning me about what is good? One there is who is good
 but * you have a desire to go into l*e
 keep the rules of the law.
 He says to him
 Which? And Jesus said
 Do not put anyone to death
 Do not be untrue in married l*e
 Do not take what is not yours
 Do not give false witness
 Give honour to your father and your mother
 and
 Have love for your neighbour as for yourself.
 The young man says to him
 All these things have I done
 what more is there?
 Jesus said to him
 If you have a desire to be complete
 go
 get money for your property
 and give it to the *
 and you will have wealth in heaven
 and come after me.
 But hearing these words the young man went away sorrowing
 for he had much property.
 And Jesus said to his disciples
 Truly I say to you
 It is hard for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of heaven.
 And again I say to you
 It is simpler for a camel to go through a needle's eye
 than for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of God.
 And the disciples
 hearing this
 were greatly surprised
 saying
 Who then may have salvation?
 And Jesus
 looking at them
 said
 With men this is not possible
 but with God all things are possible.
 Then Peter said to him
 See
 we have given up everything and have come after you
 what then will we have?
 And Jesus said to them
 Truly I say to you that in the time when all things are made new
 and the Son of man is seated in his glory
 you who have come after me will be seated on twelve seats
 judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
 And everyone who has given up houses
 or brothers
 or sisters
 or father
 or mother
 or child
 or land
 for my name
 will be given a hundred times as much
 and have eternal l*e.
 But a great number who are first will be last
 and some who are last will be first.
 For the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a house
 who went out early in the morning to get workers into his vine-garden.
 And when he had made an agreement with the workmen for a penny a day
 he sent them into his vine-garden.
 And he went out about the third hour
 and saw others in the market-place doing nothing
 And he said to them
 Go into the vine-garden with the others
 and whatever is right I will give you. And they went to work.
 Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour
 and did the same.
 And about the eleventh hour he went out and saw others doing nothing
 and he says to them
 Why are you here all the day doing nothing?
 They say to him
 Because no man has given us work. He says to them
 Go in with the rest
 into the vine-garden.
 And when evening came
 the lord of the vine-garden said to his manager
 Let the workers come
 and give them their payment
 from the last to the first.
 And when those men came who had gone to work at the eleventh hour
 they were given every man a penny.
 Then those who came first had the idea that they would get more
 and they
 like the rest
 were given a penny.
 And when they got it
 they made a protest against the master of the house
 Saying
 These last have done only one hour's work
 and you have made them equal to us
 who have undergone the hard work of the day and the burning heat.
 But he in answer said to one of them
 Friend
 I do you no *
 did you not make an agreement with me for a penny?
 Take what is yours
 and go away
 it is my pleasure to give to this last
 even as to you.
 Have I not the right to do as seems good to me in my house? or is your eye evil
 because I am good?
 So the last will be first
 and the first last.
 And when Jesus was going up to Jerusalem
 he took the twelve disciples on one side
 and said to them
 See
 we go up to Jerusalem
 and the Son of man will be given into the hands of the chief priests and scribes
 and they will give orders for him to be put to death
 And will give him up to the Gentiles to be made sport of and to be whipped and to be put to death on the cross
 and the third day he will come back again from the dead.
 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons
 giving him worship and making a request of him.
 And he said to her
 What is your desire? She says to him
 Let my two sons be seated
 the one at your right hand
 and the other at your left
 in your kingdom.
 But Jesus made answer and said
 You have no idea what you are requesting. Are you able to take of the cup which I am about to take?
 They say to him
 We are able. He says to them
 Truly
 you will take of my cup
 but to be seated at my right hand and at my left is not for me to give
 but it is for those for whom my Father has made it ready.
 And when it came to the ears of the ten
 they were angry with the two brothers.
 But Jesus said to them
 You see that the rulers of the Gentiles are lords over them
 and their great ones have authority over them.
 Let it not be so among you
 but * anyone has a desire to become great among you
 let him be your servant
 And whoever has a desire to be first among you
 let him take the lowest place
 Even as the Son of man did not come to have servants
 but to be a servant
 and to give his l*e for the salvation of men.
 And when they were going out from Jericho
 a great number went after him.
 And two blind men seated by the wayside
 when they had the news that Jesus was going by
 gave a loud cry
 saying
 Lord
 Son of David
 have mercy on us.
 And the people gave them orders to be quiet
 but they went on crying even louder
 Lord
 Son of David
 have mercy on us.
 And Jesus
 stopping
 sent for them
 and said
 What would you have me do to you?
 They say to him
 Lord
 that our eyes may be open.
 And Jesus
 being moved with pity
 put his fingers on their eyes
 and straight away they were able to see
 and went after him.
 And when they were near Jerusalem
 and had come to Beth-phage
 to the Mountain of Olives
 Jesus sent two disciples
 Saying to them
 Go into the little town in front of you
 and straight away you will see an ass with a cord round her neck
 and a young one with her
 let them loose and come with them to me.
 And * anyone says anything to you
 you will say
 The Lord has need of them
 and straight away he will send them.
 Now this took place so that these words of the prophet might come true
 Say to the daughter of Zion
 See
 your King comes to you
 gentle and seated on an ass
 and on a young ass.
 And the disciples went and did as Jesus had given them orders
 And got the ass and the young one
 and put their clothing on them
 and he took his seat on it.
 And all the people put their clothing down in the way
 and others got branches from the trees
 and put them down in the way.
 And those who went before him
 and those who came after
 gave loud cries
 saying
 Glory to the Son of David
 A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord
 Glory in the highest.
 And when he came into Jerusalem
 all the town was moved
 saying
 Who is this?
 And the people said
 This is the prophet Jesus
 from Nazareth of Galilee.
 And Jesus went into the Temple and sent out all who were trading there
 overturning the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those trading in doves.
 And he said to them
 It is in the Writings
 My house is to be named a house of prayer
 but you are making it a hole of thieves.
 And the blind and the broken in body came to him in the Temple
 and he made them well.
 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the works of power which he did
 and the children crying out in the Temple
 Glory to the son of David
 they were angry and said to him
 Have you any idea what these are saying? And Jesus said to them
 Yes
 have you not seen in the Writings
 From the lips of children and babies at the breast you have made your praise complete?
 And he went away from them
 and went out of the town to Bethany
 and was there for the night.
 Now in the morning when he was coming back to the town
 he had a desire for food.
 And seeing a fig-tree by the wayside
 he came to it
 and saw nothing on it but leaves only
 and he said to it
 Let there be no fruit from you from this time forward for ever. And straight away the fig-tree became dry and dead.
 And when the disciples saw it they were surprised
 saying
 How did the fig-tree become dry in so short a time?
 And Jesus in answer said to them
 Truly I say to you
 If you have faith
 without doubting
 not only may you do what has been done to the fig-tree
 but even * you say to this mountain
 Be taken up and put into the sea
 it will be done.
 And all things
 whatever you make request for in prayer
 having faith
 you will get.
 And when he had come into the Temple
 the chief priests and those in authority over the people came to him while he was teaching
 and said
 By what authority do you do these things? and who gave you this authority?
 And Jesus said to them in answer
 I will put one question to you
 and * you give me the answer
 I will say by what authority I do these things.
 The baptism of John
 where did it come from? from heaven or from men? And they were reasoning among themselves
 saying
 If we say
 From heaven
 he will say to us
 Why then did you not have faith in him?
 But * we say
 From men
 we are in fear of the people
 because all take John to be a prophet.
 And they made answer and said
 We have no idea. Then he said to them
 And I will not say to you by what authority I do these things.
 But how does it seem to you? A man had two sons
 and he came to the first
 and said
 Son
 go and do work today in the vine-garden.
 And he said in answer
 I will not
 but later
 changing his decision
 he went.
 And he came to the second and said the same. And he made answer and said
 I go
 sir
 and went not.
 Which of the two did his father's pleasure? They say
 The first. Jesus said to them
 Truly I say to you
 that tax-farmers and loose women are going into the kingdom of God before you.
 For John came to you in the way of righteousness
 and you had no faith in him
 but the tax-farmers and the loose women had faith in him
 and you
 when you saw it
 did not even have regret for your sins
 so as to have faith in him.
 Give ear to another story. A master of a house made a vine garden
 and put a wall round it
 and made a place for crushing out the wine
 and made a tower
 and let it out to field-workers
 and went into another country.
 And when the time for the fruit came near
 he sent his servants to the workmen
 to get the fruit.
 And the workmen made an attack on his servants
 giving blows to one
 putting another to death
 and stoning another.
 Again
 he sent other servants more in number than the first
 and they did the same to them.
 But after that he sent his son to them
 saying
 They will have respect for my son.
 But when the workmen saw the son
 they said among themselves
 This is he who will one day be the owner of the property
 come
 let us put him to death and take his heritage.
 And they took him and
 driving him out of the vine-garden
 put him to death.
 When
 then
 the lord of the vine-garden comes
 what will he do to those workmen?
 They say to him
 He will put those cruel men to a cruel death
 and will let out the vine-garden to other workmen
 who will give him the fruit when it is ready.
 Jesus says to them
 Did you never see in the Writings
 The stone which the builders put on one side
 the same has been made the chief stone of the building
 this was the Lord's doing
 and it is a wonder in our eyes?
 For this reason I say to you
 The kingdom of God will be taken away from you
 and will be given to a nation producing the fruits of it.
 Any man falling on this stone will be broken
 but he on whom it comes down will be crushed to dust.
 And when his stories came to the ears of the chief priests and the Pharisees
 they saw that he was talking of them.
 And though they had a desire to take him
 they were in fear of the people
 because in their eyes he was a prophet.
 And Jesus
 talking to them again in stories
 said
 The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king
 who made a feast when his son was married
 And sent out his servants to get in the guests to the feast
 and they would not come.
 Again he sent out other servants
 with orders to say to the guests
 See
 I have made ready my feast
 my oxen and my fat beasts have been put to death
 and all things are ready
 come to the feast.
 But they gave no attention
 and went about their business
 one to his farm
 another to his trade
 And the rest put violent hands on his servants
 and did evil to them
 and put them to death.
 But the king was angry
 and he sent his armies
 and those who had put his servants to death he gave to destruction
 burning down their town with fire.
 Then he said to his servants
 The feast is ready but the guests were not good enough.
 Go then to the cross-roads
 and get all those whom you see to come to the bride-feast.
 And those servants went out into the streets
 and got together all those whom they came across
 * and good
 and the feast was full of guests.
 But when the king came in to see the guests
 he saw there a man who had not on a guest's robe
 And he says to him
 Friend
 how came you in here not having a guest's robe? And he had nothing to say.
 Then the king said to the servants
 Put cords round his hands and feet and put him out into the dark
 there will be weeping and cries of sorrow.
 For out of all to whom the good news has come
 only a small number will get salvation.
 Then the Pharisees went and had a meeting to see how they might make use of his words to take him.
 And they sent to him their disciples
 with the Herodians
 saying
 Master
 we see that you are true
 and that you are teaching the true way of God
 and have no fear of anyone
 because you have no respect for a man's position.
 Give us
 then
 your opinion of this
 Is it right to give tax to Caesar
 or not?
 But Jesus saw their trick and said
 Oh false ones
 why are you attempting to put me in the *?
 Let me see the tax money. And they gave him a penny.
 And he said to them
 Whose is this image and name on it?
 They say to him
 Caesar's. Then he said to them
 Give to Caesar the things which are Caesar's
 and to God the things which are God's.
 And hearing it
 they were full of wonder
 and went away from him.
 On the same day there came to him the Sadducees
 who say that there is no coming back from the dead
 and they put a question to him
 saying
 Master
 Moses said
 If a man
 at the time of his death
 has no children
 let his brother take his w*e
 and get a family for his brother
 Now there were among us seven brothers
 and the first was married and at his death
 having no seed
 gave his w*e to his brother
 In the same way the second and the third
 up to the seventh.
 And last of all the woman came to her end.
 When they come back from the dead
 then
 whose w*e will she be of the seven? because they all had her.
 But Jesus said to them in answer
 You are in error
 not having knowledge of the Writings
 or of the power of God.
 For when they come back from the dead there are no husbands and wives
 but they are as the angels in heaven.
 But about the dead coming back to l*e
 have you no knowledge of what was said to you by God in the Writings
 I am the God of Abraham
 and the God of Isaac
 and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead but of the living.
 And the people hearing it were surprised at his teaching.
 But the Pharisees
 hearing how the mouths of the Sadducees had been stopped
 came together
 And one of them
 a teacher of the law
 put a question to him
 testing him
 and saying
 Master
 which is the chief rule in the law?
 And he said to him
 Have love for the Lord your God with all your heart
 and with all your soul
 and with all your mind.
 This is the first and greatest rule.
 And a second like it is this
 Have love for your neighbour as for yourself.
 On these two rules all the law and the prophets are based.
 Now while the Pharisees were together
 Jesus put a question to them
 saying
 What is your opinion of the Christ? whose son is he? They say to him
 The Son of David.
 He says to them
 How then does David in the Spirit give him the name of Lord
 saying
 The Lord said to my Lord
 Be seated at my right hand
 till I put under your feet all those who are against you?
 If David then gives him the name of Lord
 how is he his son?
 And no one was able to give him an answer
 and so great was their fear of him
 that from that day no one put any more questions to him.
 Then Jesus said to the people and to his disciples
 The scribes and the Pharisees have the authority of Moses
 All things
 then
 which they give you orders to do
 these do and keep
 but do not take their works as your example
 for they say and do not.
 They make hard laws and put great weights on men's backs
 but they themselves will not put a finger to them.
 But all their works they do so as to be seen by men
 for they make wide their phylacteries
 and the edges of their robes
 And the things desired by them are the first places at feasts
 and the chief seats in the Synagogues
 And words of respect in the market-places
 and to be named by men
 Teacher.
 But you may not be named Teacher
 for one is your teacher
 and you are all brothers.
 And give no man the name of father on earth
 because one is your Father
 who is in heaven.
 And you may not be named guides
 because one is your Guide
 even Christ.
 But let the greatest among you be your servant.
 And whoever makes himself high will be made low
 and whoever makes himself low will be made high.
 But a curse is on you
 scribes and Pharisees
 false ones! because you are shutting the kingdom of heaven against men
 for you do not go in yourselves
 and those who are going in
 you keep back.
 []
 A curse is on you
 scribes and Pharisees
 false ones! for you go about land and sea to get one disciple and
 having him
 you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.
 A curse is on you
 blind guides
 who say
 Whoever takes an oath by the Temple
 it is nothing
 but whoever takes an oath by the gold of the Temple
 he is responsible.
 You foolish ones and blind
 which is greater
 the gold
 or the Temple which makes the gold holy?
 And
 Whoever takes an oath by the altar
 it is nothing
 but whoever takes an oath by the offering which is on it
 he is responsible.
 You blind ones
 which is greater
 the offering
 or the altar which makes the offering holy?
 He
 then
 who takes an oath by the altar
 takes it by the altar and by all things on it.
 And he who takes an oath by the Temple
 takes it by the Temple and by him whose house it is.
 And he who takes an oath by heaven
 takes it by the seat of God
 and by him who is seated on it.
 A curse is on you
 scribes and Pharisees
 false ones! for you make men give a tenth of all sorts of sweet-smelling plants
 but you give no thought to the more important things of the law
 righteousness
 and mercy
 and faith
 but it is right for you to do these
 and not to let the others be undone.
 You blind guides
 who take out a fly from your drink
 but make no trouble over a camel.
 A curse is on you
 scribes and Pharisees
 false ones! for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the plate
 but inside they are full of violent behaviour and uncontrolled desire.
 You blind Pharisee
 first make clean the inside of the cup and of the plate
 so that the outside may become equally clean.
 A curse is on you
 scribes and Pharisees
 false ones! for you are like the resting-places of the dead
 which are made white
 and seem beaut*ul on the outside
 but inside are full of dead men's bones and of all unclean things.
 Even so you seem to men to be full of righteousness
 but inside you are all false and full of *doing.
 A curse is on you
 scribes and Pharisees
 false ones! because you put up buildings for housing the dead bodies of the prophets
 and make fair the last resting-places of good men
 and say
 If we had been living in the days of our fathers
 we would not have taken part with them in the blood of the prophets.
 So that you are witnesses against yourselves that you are the sons of those who put the prophets to death.
 Make full
 then
 the measure of your fathers.
 You snakes
 offspring of snakes
 how will you be kept from the punishment of hell?
 For this reason
 I send you prophets
 and wise men
 and scribes
 some of them you will put to death and put on the cross
 and to some of them you will give blows in your Synagogues
 driving them from town to town
 So that on you may come all the blood of the upright on the earth
 from the blood of upright Abel to the blood of Zachariah
 son of Barachiah
 whom you put to death between the Temple and the altar.
 Truly I say to you
 All these things will come on this generation.
 O Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 putting to death the prophets
 and stoning those who are sent to her! Again and again would I have taken your children to myself as a bird takes her young ones under her wings
 and you would not!
 See
 your house is made waste.
 For I say to you
 You will not see me from this time till you say
 A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord.
 And Jesus went out of the Temple
 and on the way his disciples came to him
 pointing out the buildings of the Temple.
 But he
 answering
 said to them
 See you not all these things? truly I say to you that here there will not be one stone resting on another
 which will not be pulled down.
 And while he was seated on the Mountain of Olives
 the disciples came to him privately
 saying
 Make clear to us
 when will these things be? and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world?
 And Jesus said to them in answer
 Take care that you are not tricked.
 For people will come in my name
 saying
 I am the Christ
 and a number will be turned from the true way through them.
 And news will come to you of wars and talk of wars
 do not be troubled
 for these things have to be
 but it is still not the end.
 For nation will be moved against nation
 and kingdom against kingdom
 and men will be without food
 and the earth will be shaking in d*ferent places
 But all these things are the first of the troubles.
 Then they will be cruel to you
 and will put you to death
 and you will be hated by all nations because of my name.
 And numbers of people will be turned from the right way
 and will give one another up and have hate for one another.
 And a number of false prophets will come
 causing error.
 And because *doing will be increased
 the love of most people will become cold.
 But he who goes through to the end will get salvation.
 And this good news of the kingdom will be given through all the world for a witness to all nations
 and then the end will come.
 When
 then
 you see in the holy place the unclean thing which makes destruction
 of which word was given by Daniel the prophet (let this be clear to the reader)
 Then let those who are in Judaea go in flight to the mountains
 Let not him who is on the house-top go down to take anything out of his house
 And let not him who is in the field go back to get his coat.
 But it will be hard for women who are with child and for those with babies at the breast in those days.
 And say a prayer that your flight may not be in the winter
 or on a Sabbath.
 Because in those days there will be great sorrow
 such as there has not been from the start of the world till now
 or ever will be.
 And * those days had not been made short there would have been no salvation for any
 but because of the saints those days will be made short.
 Then * any man says to you
 See
 here is the Christ
 or
 Here
 do not put faith in him
 For there will come up false Christs
 and false prophets
 who will do great signs and wonders
 so that * possible even the saints might be tricked.
 See
 I have made it clear to you before it comes about.
 If
 then
 they say to you
 See
 he is in the waste land
 go not out
 See
 he is in the inner rooms
 put no faith in it.
 Because as in a thunderstorm the bright light coming from the east is seen even in the west
 so will be the coming of the Son of man.
 Wherever the dead body is
 there will the eagles come together.
 But straight away
 after the trouble of those days
 the sun will be made dark and the moon will not give her light and the stars will come down from heaven and the powers of heaven will be moved
 And then the sign of the Son of man will be seen in heaven
 and then all the nations of the earth will have sorrow
 and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
 And he will send out his angels with a great sound of a horn
 and they will get his saints together from the four winds
 from one end of heaven to the other.
 Now take an example from the fig-tree
 when her branch has become soft and puts out its leaves
 you are certain that the summer is near
 Even so
 when you see all these things
 you may be certain that he is near
 even at the doors.
 Truly I say to you
 This generation will not come to an end till all these things are complete.
 Heaven and earth will come to an end
 but my words will not come to an end.
 But of that day and hour no one has knowledge
 not even the angels in heaven
 or the Son
 but the Father only.
 And as were the days of Noah
 so will be the coming of the Son of man.
 Because as in those days before the overflowing of the waters
 they were feasting and taking wives and getting married
 till the day when Noah went into the ark
 And they had no care till the waters came and took them all away
 so will be the coming of the Son of man.
 Then two men will be in the field
 one is taken
 and one let go
 Two women will be crushing grain
 one is taken
 and one let go.
 Be watching
 then! for you have no knowledge on what day your Lord will come.
 But be certain of this
 that * the master of the house had had knowledge of the time when the thief was coming
 he would have been watching
 and would not have let his house be broken into.
 Be ready then
 for at a time which you have no thought of the Son of man will come.
 Who is the true and wise servant
 whom his lord has put over those in his house
 to give them their food at the right time?
 A blessing on that servant
 who will be doing so when his lord comes.
 Truly
 I say to you
 he will put him over all he has.
 But * that evil servant says in his heart
 My lord is a long time in coming
 And is cruel to the other servants
 taking his pleasure with those who are overcome with wine
 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he is not looking for him
 and in an hour of which he has no knowledge
 And will have him cut in two
 and will give him a part in the fate of the false ones
 there will be weeping and cries of sorrow.
 Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins
 the friends of the bride
 who took their lights
 and went out with the purpose of meeting the husband.
 And five of them were foolish
 and five were wise.
 For the foolish
 when they took their lights
 took no oil with them.
 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lights.
 Now the husband was a long time in coming
 and they all went to sleep.
 But in the middle of the night there is a cry
 The husband comes! Go out to him.
 Then all those virgins got up
 and made ready their lights.
 And the foolish said to the wise
 Give us of your oil
 for our lights are going out.
 But the wise made answer
 saying
 There may not be enough for us and you
 it would be better for you to go to the traders and get oil for yourselves.
 And while they went to get oil
 the master came
 and those who were ready went in with him to the feast
 and the door was shut.
 After that the other virgins came
 saying
 Lord
 Lord
 let us in.
 But he made answer and said
 Truly I say to you
 I have no knowledge of you.
 Keep watch
 then
 because you are not certain of the day or of the hour.
 For it is as when a man
 about to take a journey
 got his servants together
 and gave them his property.
 And to one he gave five talents
 to another two
 to another one
 to everyone as he was able
 and he went on his journey.
 Straight away he who had been given the five talents went and did trade with them
 and made five more.
 In the same way he who had been given the two got two more.
 But he who was given the one went away and put it in a hole in the earth
 and kept his lord's money in a secret place.
 Now after a long time the lord of those servants comes
 and makes up his account with them.
 And he who had the five talents came with his other five talents
 saying
 Lord
 you gave into my care five talents
 see
 I have got five more.
 His lord said to him
 Well done
 good and true servant
 you have been true in a small thing
 I will give you control over great things
 take your part in the joy of your lord.
 And he who had the two talents came and said
 Lord
 you gave into my care two talents
 see
 I have got two more.
 His lord said to him
 Well done
 good and true servant
 you have been true in a small thing
 I will give you control over great things
 take your part in the joy of your lord.
 And he who had had the one talent came and said
 Lord
 I had knowledge that you are a hard man
 getting in grain where you have not put seed
 and making profits for which you have done no work
 And I was in fear
 and went away
 and put your talent in the earth
 here is what is yours.
 But his lord in answer said to him
 You are a * and unready servant
 * you had knowledge that I get in grain where I did not put seed
 and make profits for which I have done no work
 Why
 then
 did you not put my money in the bank
 and at my coming I would have got back what is mine with interest?
 Take away
 then
 his talent and give it to him who has the ten talents.
 For to everyone who has will be given
 and he will have more
 but from him who has not
 even what he has will be taken away.
 And put out the servant who is of no profit into the outer dark
 there will be weeping and cries of sorrow.
 But when the Son of man comes in his glory
 and all the angels with him
 then will he be seated in his glory
 And before him all the nations will come together
 and they will be parted one from another
 as the sheep are parted from the goats by the keeper.
 And he will put the sheep on his right
 but the goats on the left.
 Then will the King say to those on his right
 Come
 you who have the blessing of my Father
 into the kingdom made ready for you before the world was
 For I was in need of food
 and you gave it to me
 I was in need of drink
 and you gave it to me
 I was wandering
 and you took me in
 I had no clothing
 and you gave it to me
 when I was ill
 or in prison
 you came to me.
 Then will the upright make answer to him
 saying
 Lord
 when did we see you in need of food
 and give it to you? or in need of drink
 and give it to you?
 And when did we see you wandering
 and take you in? or without clothing
 and give it to you?
 And when did we see you ill
 or in prison
 and come to you?
 And the King will make answer and say to them
 Truly I say to you
 Because you did it to the least of these my brothers
 you did it to me.
 Then will he say to those on the left
 Go from me
 you cursed ones
 into the eternal fire which is ready for the Evil One and his angels
 For I was in need of food
 and you gave it not to me
 I was in need of drink
 and you gave it not to me
 I was wandering
 and you took me not in
 without clothing
 and you gave me no clothing
 ill
 and in prison
 and you came not to me.
 Then will they make answer
 saying
 Lord
 when did we see you in need of food or drink
 or wandering
 or without clothing
 or ill
 or in prison
 and did not take care of you?
 Then will he make answer to them
 saying
 Truly I say to you
 Because you did it not to the least of these
 you did it not to me.
 And these will go away into eternal punishment
 but the upright into eternal l*e.
 And when Jesus had come to the end of all these words
 he said to his disciples
 After two days is the Passover
 and the Son of man will be given up to the death of the cross.
 Then the chief priests and the rulers of the people came together in the house of the high priest
 who was named Caiaphas.
 And they made designs together to take Jesus by some trick
 and put him to death.
 But they said
 Not while the feast is going on
 for fear of trouble among the people.
 Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper
 There came to him a woman having a bottle of perfume of great price
 and she put the perfume on his head when he was seated at table.
 But when the disciples saw it they were angry
 saying
 To what purpose is this waste?
 For we might have got much money for this and given it to the *.
 But Jesus
 seeing it
 said to them
 Why are you troubling the woman? she has done a kind act to me.
 For the * you have ever with you
 but me you have not for ever.
 For in putting this perfume on my body
 she did it to make me ready for my last resting-place.
 Truly I say to you
 Wherever this good news goes out in all the world
 what this woman has done will be talked of in memory of her.
 Then one of the twelve
 who was named Judas Iscariot
 went to the chief priests and said
 What will you give me
 * I give him up to you? And the price was fixed at thirty bits of silver.
 And from that time he was watching for a chance to give him into their hands.
 Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus
 saying
 Where are we to make ready for you to take the Passover meal?
 And he said to them
 Go into the town to such a man
 and say to him
 The Master says
 My time is near
 I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.
 And the disciples did as Jesus had said to them
 and they made ready the Passover.
 Now when evening was come
 he was seated at table with the twelve disciples
 And while they were taking food
 he said
 Truly I say to you that one of you will be false to me.
 And they were very said
 and said to him
 one by one
 Is it I
 Lord?
 And he made answer and said
 He who puts his hand into the plate with me
 the same will be false to me.
 The Son of man goes
 even as the Writings say of him
 but a curse is on that man through whom the Son of man is given up
 it would have been well for that man * he had never come into the world.
 And Judas
 who was false to him
 made answer and said
 Is it I
 Master? He says to him
 Yes.
 And when they were taking food
 Jesus took bread and
 after blessing it
 he gave the broken bread to the disciples and said
 Take it
 this is my body.
 And he took a cup and
 having given praise
 he gave it to them
 saying
 Take of it
 all of you
 for this is my blood of the testament
 which is given for men for the forgiveness of sins.
 But I say to you that from now I will not take of this fruit of the vine
 till that day when I take it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
 And after a song of praise to God
 they went out to the Mountain of Olives.
 Then said Jesus to them
 All of you will be turned away from me this night
 for it is said in the Writings
 I will put to death the keeper of the sheep
 and the sheep of the flock will be put to flight.
 But after I am come back from the dead
 I will go before you into Galilee.
 But Peter made answer and said to him
 Though all may be turned away from you
 I will never be turned away.
 Jesus said to him
 Truly I say to you that this night
 before the hour of the cock's cry
 you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me.
 Peter says to him
 Even * I am put to death with you
 I will not be false to you. So said all the disciples.
 Then comes Jesus with them to a place named Gethsemane
 and says to his disciples
 Be seated here
 while I go over there for prayer.
 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee
 and became sad and very troubled.
 Then says he to them
 My soul is very sad
 even to death
 keep watch with me here.
 And he went forward a little
 and falling down on his face in prayer
 he said
 O my Father
 * it is possible
 let this cup go from me
 but let not my pleasure
 but yours be done.
 And he comes to the disciples
 and sees that they are sleeping
 and says to Peter
 What
 were you not able to keep watch with me one hour?
 Keep watch with prayer
 so that you may not be put to the test
 the spirit truly is ready
 but the flesh is feeble.
 Again
 a second time he went away
 and said in prayer
 O my Father
 * this may not go from me without my taking it
 let your pleasure be done.
 And he came again and saw them sleeping
 for their eyes were tired.
 And he went away from them again
 and a third time said the same prayer.
 Then he comes to the disciples
 and says to them
 Go on sleeping now
 and take your rest
 for the hour is come
 and the Son of man is given into the hands of evil men.
 Up
 let us be going
 see
 he who gives me up is near.
 And while he was still talking
 Judas
 one of the twelve
 came
 and with him a band armed with swords and sticks
 from the chief priests and those in authority over the people.
 Now the false one had given them a sign saying
 The one to whom I give a kiss
 that is he
 take him.
 And straight away he came to Jesus and said
 Master! and gave him a kiss.
 And Jesus said to him
 Friend
 do that for which you have come. Then they came and put hands on Jesus
 and took him.
 And one of those who were with Jesus put out his hand
 and took out his sword and gave the servant of the high priest a blow
 cutting off his ear.
 Then says Jesus to him
 Put up your sword again into its place
 for all those who take the sword will come to death by the sword.
 Does it not seem possible to you that * I make request to my Father he will even now send me an army of angels?
 But how then would the Writings come true
 which say that so it has to be?
 In that hour Jesus said to the people
 Have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me? I was teaching every day in the Temple and you took me not.
 But all this has taken place so that the writings of the prophets might come true. Then all his disciples went from him in flight.
 And those who had made Jesus prisoner took him away to the house of Caiaphas
 the high priest
 where the scribes and those in authority over the people had come together.
 But Peter went after him at a distance
 to the house of the high priest
 and went in and took his seat with the servants
 to see the end.
 Now the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for false witness against Jesus
 so that they might put him to death
 And they were not able to get it
 though a number of false witnesses came.
 But later there came two who said
 This man said
 I am able to give the Temple of God to destruction
 and to put it up again in three days.
 And the high priest got up and said to him
 Have you no answer? what is it which these say against you?
 But Jesus said not a word. And the high priest said to him
 I put you on oath
 by the living God
 that you will say to us * you are the Christ
 the Son of God.
 Jesus says to him
 You say so
 but I say to you
 From now you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power
 and coming on the clouds of heaven.
 Then the high priest
 violently parting his robes
 said
 He has said evil against God
 what more need have we of witnesses? for now his words against God have come to your ears
 What is your opinion? They made answer and said
 It is right for him to be put to death.
 Then they put shame on him
 and were cruel to him
 and some gave him blows
 saying
 Be a prophet
 O Christ
 and say who gave you a blow!
 Now Peter was seated in the open square outside the house
 and a servant-girl came to him
 saying
 You were with Jesus the Galilaean.
 But he said before them all that it was false
 saying
 I have no knowledge of what you say.
 And when he had gone out into the doorway
 another saw him and says to those who were there
 This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.
 And again he said with an oath
 I have no knowledge of the man.
 And after a little time those who were near came and said to Peter
 Truly you are one of them
 because your talk is witness against you.
 Then with curses and oaths he said
 I have no knowledge of the man. And straight away there came the cry of a cock.
 And the word of Jesus came back to Peter
 when he said
 Before the hour of the cock's cry
 you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me. And he went out
 weeping bitterly.
 Now when it was morning
 all the chief priests and those in authority took thought together with the purpose of putting Jesus to death.
 And they put cords on him and took him away
 and gave him up to Pilate
 the ruler.
 Then Judas
 who was false to him
 seeing that he was to be put to death
 in his regret took back the thirty bits of silver to the chief priests and those in authority
 Saying
 I have done * in giving into your hands an upright man. But they said
 What is that to us? it is your business.
 And he put down the silver in the Temple and went out
 and put himself to death by hanging.
 And the chief priests took the silver and said
 It is not right to put it in the Temple store for it is the price of blood.
 And they made a decision to get with the silver the potter's field
 as a place for the dead of other countries.
 For this cause that field was named
 The field of blood
 to this day.
 Then came true that which was said by Jeremiah the prophet
 And they took the thirty bits of silver
 the price of him who was valued by the children of Israel
 And they gave them for the potter's field
 as I had word from the Lord.
 And Jesus was before the ruler
 who put a question to him
 Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him
 You say so.
 But when the chief priests and those in authority made statements against him
 he gave no answer.
 Then says Pilate to him
 Do you give no attention to what their witnesses say against you?
 And he gave him no answer
 not even a word
 so that the ruler was greatly surprised.
 Now at the feast it was the way for the ruler to let free to the people one prisoner
 at their selection.
 And they had then an important prisoner
 whose name was Barabbas.
 So when they came together
 Pilate said to them
 Whom will you have? Barabbas
 or Jesus
 who is named Christ?
 For he saw that for envy they had given him up.
 And while he was on the judge's seat
 his w*e sent to him
 saying
 Have nothing to do with that upright man
 for I have had much trouble this day in a dream because of him.
 Now the chief priests and those in authority got the people to make request for Barabbas
 and for Jesus to be put to death.
 But the ruler made answer and said to them
 Which of the two is it your pleasure that I let go free? And they said
 Barabbas.
 Pilate says to them
 What
 then
 am I to do with Jesus
 who is named Christ? They all say
 Let him be put to death on the cross.
 And he said
 Why
 what evil has he done? But they gave loud cries
 saying
 To the cross with him!
 So when Pilate saw that he was able to do nothing
 but that trouble was working up
 he took water and
 washing his hands before the people
 said
 The blood of this upright man is not on my hands
 you are responsible.
 And all the people made answer and said
 Let his blood be on us
 and on our children.
 Then he let Barabbas go free
 but after having Jesus whipped
 he gave him up to be put to death on the cross.
 Then the ruler's armed men took Jesus into the open square
 and got all their band together.
 And they took off his clothing
 and put on him a red robe.
 And they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head
 and put a rod in his right hand
 and they went down on their knees before him
 and made sport of him
 saying
 Long l*e to the King of the Jews.
 And they put shame on him
 and gave him blows on the head with the rod.
 And when they had made sport of him
 they took the robe off him
 and put his clothing on him
 and took him away to put him on the cross.
 And while they were coming out
 they saw a man of Cyrene
 Simon by name
 and they made him go with them
 so that he might take up his cross.
 And when they came to the place named Golgotha
 that is to say
 Dead Man's Head
 They gave him wine mixed with bitter drink
 and after tasting it
 he took no more.
 And when they had put him on the cross
 they made division of his clothing among them by the decision of chance.
 And they were seated there watching him.
 And they put up over his head the statement of his crime in writing
 THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
 Then two thieves were put on crosses with him
 one on the right and one on the left.
 And those who went by said bitter words to him
 shaking their heads and saying
 You who would give the Temple to destruction and put it up again in three days
 get yourself free
 * you are the Son of God
 come down from the cross.
 In the same way
 the chief priests
 making sport of him
 with the scribes and those in authority
 said
 A saviour of others
 he has no salvation for himself. If he is the King of Israel
 let him now come down from the cross
 and we will have faith in him.
 He put his faith in God
 let God be his saviour now
 * he will have him
 for he said
 I am the Son of God.
 And the thieves who were on the crosses said evil words to him.
 Now from the sixth hour it was dark over all the land till the ninth hour.
 And about the ninth hour Jesus gave a loud cry
 saying
 Eli
 Eli
 lama sabachthani? that is
 My God
 my God
 why are you turned away from me?
 And some of those who were near by
 hearing it
 said
 This man is crying to Elijah.
 And straight away one of them went quickly
 and took a sponge
 and made it full of bitter wine
 and put it on a rod and gave him drink.
 And the rest said
 Let him be
 let us see * Elijah will come to his help.
 And Jesus gave another loud cry
 and gave up his spirit.
 And the curtain of the Temple was parted in two from end to end
 and there was an earth-shock
 and the rocks were broken
 And the resting-places of the dead came open
 and the bodies of a number of sleeping saints came to l*e
 And coming out of their resting-places
 after he had come again from the dead
 they went into the holy town and were seen by a number of people.
 Now the captain and those who were with him watching Jesus
 when they saw the earth-shock and the things which were done
 were in great fear and said
 Truly this was a son of God.
 And a number of women were there
 watching from a distance
 who had come with Jesus from Galilee
 waiting on his needs.
 Among whom was Mary Magdalene
 and Mary
 the mother of James and Joses
 and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
 And in the evening
 there came a man of wealth from Arimathaea
 Joseph by name
 who was a disciple of Jesus
 This man went in to Pilate
 and made a request for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate gave orders for it to be given to him.
 And Joseph took the body
 folding it in clean linen
 And put it in the resting-place which had been cut out of the rock for himself
 and after rolling a great stone to the door of it he went away.
 And Mary Magdalene was there
 and the other Mary
 seated by the place of the dead.
 Now on the day after the getting ready of the Passover
 the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate
 Saying
 Sir
 we have in mind how that false man said
 while he was still living
 After three days I will come again from the dead.
 Give orders
 then
 that the place where his body is may be made safe till the third day
 for fear that his disciples come and take him away secretly and say to the people
 He has come back from the dead
 and the last error will be worse than the first.
 Pilate said to them
 You have watchmen
 go and make it as safe as you are able.
 So they went
 and made safe the place where his body was
 putting a stamp on the stone
 and the watchmen were with them.
 Now late on the Sabbath
 when the dawn of the first day of the week was near
 Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the place where his body was.
 And there was a great earth-shock
 for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and
 rolling back the stone
 took his seat on it.
 His form was shining like the light
 and his clothing was white as snow
 And for fear of him the watchmen were shaking
 and became as dead men.
 And the angel said to the women
 Have no fear
 for I see that you are searching for Jesus
 who was put to death on the cross.
 He is not here
 for he has come to l*e again
 even as he said. Come
 see the Lord's resting-place.
 And go quickly and give his disciples the news that he has come back from the dead
 and is going before you into Galilee
 there you will see him
 as I have said to you.
 And they went away quickly
 with fear and great joy
 to give his disciples the news.
 And on the way
 Jesus came to them
 saying
 Be glad. And they came and put their hands on his feet
 and gave him worship.
 Then said Jesus to them
 Have no fear
 go and give word to my brothers to go into Galilee
 and there they will see me.
 Now
 while they were going
 some of the watchmen came into the town and gave news to the chief priests of all the things which had taken place.
 And when they had come together with those in authority
 and had made their decision
 they gave much money to the watchmen
 saying
 Say
 His disciples came by night and took him away secretly while we were sleeping.
 And * this comes to the ruler's ears
 we will see that he does not make you responsible.
 So they took the money
 and did as they had been ordered
 and this account has been current among the Jews till the present time.
 But the eleven disciples went into Galilee
 to the mountain where Jesus had given them orders to go.
 And when they saw him they gave him worship
 but some were in doubt.
 And Jesus came to them and said
 All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
 Go then
 and make disciples of all the nations
 giving them baptism in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
 Teaching them to keep all the rules which I have given you
 and see
I am ever with you even to the end of the world.
