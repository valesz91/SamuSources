Pete likes cars.
Jo likes cars too.
He has many toy-cars.
He has a ferrari.
He has a truck.
He has a hot wheel.
He has a racing set too.
But he has no friends to play with.
Once Jo came to play with.
Jo is a nice, shy boy.
He is poor.
He has no toy-cars.
Jo asked Pete to play together.
Pete was selfish.
Because he don't wanted to give Jo any car.
He was afraid, that Jo gonna broke them.
Pete wanted to play alone.
He hit Jo.
Jo biginn to cry.
And he gonne home.
Pete was alone with his cars
But he was sad.
It was not fun playing alone.
He went to Pete.
He apologized.
He gave one of the cars to Pete.
Pete was happy.
They go back to Pete's house.
Now they can play together.
They build a racetrack.
It was big.
They made it from wood.
And then paint it.
It was grey.
Pete start the game.
First Pete wins.
Second too.
Third Jo wins.
They play a lot.
They have fun.
The sun falls
and Jo want to go home.
Pete asked Jo
to come over the next day.
He agreed.
They both was happy. 
It was a good day.
